# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Network Requests (Dart)

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling in asynchronous network operations. The original code lacks robust error handling, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior. The solution offers improved error management using more informative error messages and more sophisticated exception handling.

## Bug

The `bug.dart` file contains code that makes a network request. If the request fails (due to network issues, server errors, or invalid URLs), the error handling is insufficient. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in the application.  The current `catch` block simply prints the error, without detailed context or options for recovery.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution. The improvements include:

* **More specific error messages:**  The error message now includes the status code of the HTTP response, providing more diagnostic information.
* **Custom exception types:** While not shown here, consider creating custom exception classes to represent specific types of errors for better error handling and classification.
* **Retry mechanisms (not included):**  Advanced error handling could include mechanisms to retry failed requests after a delay.
* **Error reporting (not included):** Consider sending error reports to a logging service or using a dedicated error tracking system.
